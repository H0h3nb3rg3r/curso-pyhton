#it's better to use double quotes, in case you need to write for example: it's

#there's another way to print in more than one line with just one print:
print("History Dickory Dock! \nThe mouse ran up the clock!")

print("""line one
line two
      line three

#you can use 3 quotes at the start and 3 quotes at the end in one print - this code makes you print in multiple lines with just one print

print('here is a double quote"' + "here is a single quote'")
print("or you can just do this \" does that work") 

#\t gives a space in the line:
print("what\thappens")

print("can I just print a \ on the screen?\nYes, we can!")

#I am inserting a \\ so the \ apperars correctly in the string:
print("But what if I just want \\news")
