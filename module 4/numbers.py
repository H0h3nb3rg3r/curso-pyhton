#Most common math operations:
#Symbol | Operation      | Example
# +     | addition       | 5+2=7
# -     | subtraction    | 5-2=3
# *     | multiplication | 5*2=10
# /     | division       | 5/2=2.5
# **    | exponent       | 5**2=25
# %     | modulo         | 5%2=1   - modulo is the rest of a division
#we don't use modulo so much on day by day, but we use it. We can use it to generate credit ou debit card numbers

#Order of opperations:
# () parentheses
# ** exponent (e.g. **2 squared **3 cubed) - squarred: "ao quadrado", cubed: "ao cubo"
# */ multiplication and division
# +- addition and subtraction



#e.g. program of the class:

area = 0 #that line is optional
height2 = 10
width2 = 20
#calculate the area of a triangle
area = width2 * height2 /2
