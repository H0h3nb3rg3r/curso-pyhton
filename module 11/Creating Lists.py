#List of values:
#to remember names, e.g.:
guests = ["Christopher", "Susan", "Bill", "Satya"]
scores = [78,85,62,49,98]
#create two different lists, it's better than creating a list with numbers and strings inside
#You can also create an empty list and add the values later:
guests1 = []
scores1 = []


#To print the first value in a list:
print(guests[0]) #It will print "Christopher"

#IMPORTANT --- THE COUNT STARTS IN 0 --- IMPORTANT

print(scores[3]) #It will print "49"




#You can even count backwards:
print(guests[-1]) #It will print "Satya"

print(scores[-2]) #It will print "49"

#IMPORTANT --- WHEN THE COUNT IS BACKWARDS, THE COUNT STARTS IN -1 --- IMPORTANT



#E.g.:
guests2 = ["Christopher", "Susan", "Bill", "Satya"]
print(guests2[0])
print(guests2[1])
